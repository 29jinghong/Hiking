# Hiking with Friends 🥾🌲

This is a personal photo map project to showcase hiking adventures with my friend.  
Each pin on the map represents a trail or spot we’ve visited, with photos taken along the way.

## 📍 Current Locations
- **Blood Mountain, GA** – Peaceful views, stone slopes, and mountain breezes.

## 🔧 Built With
- HTML & CSS
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com) – Interactive map
- OpenStreetMap for base tiles

## 💡 Goals
- Add more hiking locations and photos
- Track our trail history visually
- Possibly expand into a full hiking journal with notes and routes

Because every hike tells a story — and this is ours.
